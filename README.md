# Compatibility between react, preact and inferno

This repo wants to be a comparison between react, preact and inferno.

Both preact and inferno have a compatibility layer that should minimize the changes needed for a migration from react.

## Installation

npm install
```

## Usage
```
// run the app using react at localhost:3101
npm run react

// run the app using preact at localhost:3102
